Title: Chance Encounter

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

The coffee shop bustles with activity. ALICE, a young woman in her mid-twenties, sits alone at a table, sipping her drink. Enter BOB, a man around the same age, who notices Alice and approaches her table.

BOB: Excuse me, is this seat taken?

ALICE: (looking up from her book) Oh, no, it's free. Please, have a seat.

Bob sits down across from Alice, smiling.

BOB: Thanks. I'm Bob.

ALICE: Alice. Nice to meet you, Bob.

They share a brief smile.

BOB: What are you reading?

ALICE: Just a novel. Escaping reality for a bit.

BOB: (chuckling) I get that. Mind if I join you in reality for a while?

ALICE: (smirking) Depends. Are you going to talk about politics or the weather?

BOB: (laughing) Neither, I promise. How about we start with something safe, like... favorite coffee drinks?

ALICE: (grinning) Now you are speaking my language.
